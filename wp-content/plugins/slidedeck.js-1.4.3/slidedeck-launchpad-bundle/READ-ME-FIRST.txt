Dear Designers & Developers,

We've created this Classic Skin Template for easy
creation of SlideDecks. We've included a Photoshop
document that you can easily modify to create your
own custom skins. The HTML document is heavily
commented so our developer friends can understand
how to work with SlideDeck. You'll want to navigate
through the package and change areas where "CHANGEME"
is displayed. We want you to come up with awesome
custom names for your own skin. It's your baby, you
name it! "CHANGEME" is listed in file names & throughout
the code. If you've purchased a PRO version of the
SlideDeck library, you can replace the LITE library
with your version of PRO, and correct the appropriate
areas within the code.

Happy Designing & Coding!
Love,
SlideDeck Staff
