* [Support](http://dtelepathy.zendesk.com/)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `slidedeck2-personal` folder and all its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new SlideDeck from the “SlideDeck » Manage” menu in the control panel sidebar
4. Insert a SlideDeck in your post or page by clicking on the "Embed a SlideDeck" button above the rich text editor in the post/page view.

You can also place a SlideDeck in your template or theme via the PHP command “do_shortcode()”. Just pass the ID of the SlideDeck you want to render. For example:
`<?php echo do_shortcode( "[SlideDeck2 id=1644]" ); ?>`

Where 1644 is the SlideDeck's ID. You can also see this code snippet when you save a new SlideDeck for the first time.
